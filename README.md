First of all, I appreciate P.I Works for considering me. In the dataset.py file everything works as I want. However, I get a column name error in the imputed_dataset.py file. I did a few checks, but when I couldn't fix it, I deleted the file. I still wanted to send both files because it would not be enough to just throw away the file in which I did the imputation and data balancing work. 
Kind regards
